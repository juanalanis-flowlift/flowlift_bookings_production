	You are working on an existing FlowLift bookings web app. The app already has these main sections/screens: Dashboard (Overview), Services, Team, Bookings (List + Calendar + Team Load), Availability (Working Hours + Block Time Off), and Business. Implement a 3-tier system (Starter, Pro+, Teams) inside the existing UI with minimal friction.
	
	GOAL
	1) Keep the app fully usable for Starter users (they must be able to run bookings end-to-end).
	2) Make higher-tier features visible in a “soft” way (placeholders + subtle labels), without annoying popups.
	3) Only show upgrade prompts when the user tries to use a gated feature.
	
	TIERS (3)
	- Starter (Free): solo operator, basic bookings, no customization.
	- Pro+: solo professional, multiple services, photos + branding + booking rules + QR code + basic integrations.
	- Teams: multi-staff operations: team management, staff assignment, per-person availability, workload/team views, and advanced integrations.
	
	GLOBAL NAVIGATION RULES
	- Team menu item is visible ONLY for Teams tier. Hide it completely for Starter and Pro+.
	- If a non-Teams user tries to access Team via direct URL or link, show the upgrade explanation (not an error page).
	
	BUSINESS SECTION 
	
	1) Business → Profile:
	   - Business name, category, description, location, contact info, social links (available for all tiers)
	2) Business → Booking Page:
	   - Booking page URL (all tiers)
	   - QR code (Pro+)
	   - Logo and cover image (Pro+)
	   - “Show photos in booking page” toggle (Pro+)
	3) Business → Policies:
	   - Terms & Conditions text 
	   - Toggles: “Show on booking page” and “Include in email” 
	Keep Policies available to all tiers.
	
	SCREEN-BY-SCREEN FUNCTIONALITY (GATE / MOVE / HIDE)
	
	A) DASHBOARD / OVERVIEW
	- Starter: show "last week", "todays booking" and “next 7 days”. Hide advanced metric cards such as “Completed Bookings Last Week”, "Daily Occupation Rate" and “Booked Services Last Week”.
	- Pro+/Teams: show the metric cards.
	
	B) SERVICES
	Common to all tiers: service name, description, duration, price, tags, active toggle, and “requires confirmation” toggle.
	- Starter:
	  - Limit to 1 total service. Once they reach the limit, disable “Add Service” and show a subtle inline message: “Available in Pro+”.
	  - Do NOT show service image upload controls.
	- Pro+:
	  - Allow multiple services.
	- Teams:
	  - Everything in Pro+, plus staff assignment inside the service editor (assign which staff can perform each service).
	
	C) TEAM (Teams tier only)
	- Hide Team section completely for Starter and Pro+.
	
	D) BOOKINGS
	- All tiers: List and Calendar tabs remain available.
	- Teams only:
	  - Show “Team Load” tab
	  - Allow filtering by staff
	  - Allow booking team member reassignment (if supported)
	- Starter/Pro+: hide the Team Load tab completely (do not show a disabled tab).
	
	E) AVAILABILITY
	- All tiers: weekly working hours and blocked time off exist.
	- Starter:
	  - Block time off must be single-day only (no multi-day ranges).
	- Pro+/Teams:
	  - Allow multi-day date ranges for blocked time off and vacation ranges.
	- Teams:
	  - Availability per staff member (individual schedules and time off).
	
	F) INTEGRATIONS / CALENDAR SYNC (if present in UI)
	- Customer “Add to calendar” buttons/links after booking confirmation must remain available to all tiers.
	
	UPGRADE EXPERIENCE (MINIMAL FRICTION)
	- Do not show upgrade popups on page load.
	- Softly show gated features using placeholders + small labels:
	  - “Available in Pro+” or “Available in Teams”
	- Only when the user clicks a gated control, show ONE reusable upgrade modal (same design everywhere):
	  Modal content structure:
	  - Title: context-specific (e.g., “Add photos to your services” / “Manage your team”)
	  - Up to 4 bullets explaining what they get
	  - Buttons: “Upgrade to Pro+” or “Upgrade to Teams”, plus “Not now”
	- Do not block users from viewing the screen; only block the specific action.
	
	FINAL CHECKS (must pass)
	- Starter can: create 1 service, set working hours, accept bookings, view/manage bookings, and customers can complete the booking flow.
	- Pro+ can: add multiple services, upload service photos,  use QR code, and manage booking rules.
	- Teams can: manage team members, assign services to staff, manage staff availability, and access Team Load.
